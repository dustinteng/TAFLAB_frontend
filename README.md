# TAFLAB Swarm Boat System

An integrated multi-robot platform for oceanic data collection using autonomous sailboats. The system is composed of three main components:

- A **ROS2-based control system** running on Raspberry Pi (boat side)
- A **Flask-based backend** for communication, data collection, and storage (shore side)
- A **React frontend dashboard** for real-time visualization, control, and analysis

## 🛍️ Repositories Overview

### 🔹 [TAFLAB_boatpi_roshumble](https://github.com/dustinteng/TAFLAB_boatpi_roshumble)

> ROS2 Humble stack deployed on each Raspberry Pi-equipped sailboat

- Nodes control rudder, sail, and motor
- Publishes GPS, IMU, and sensor data
- Communicates with the backend via XBee
- Launch file structure under `captain/launch/`

### 🔹 [TAFLAB_backend](https://github.com/dustinteng/TAFLAB_backend)

> Flask backend to receive, store, and serve telemetry data

- Accepts data from boats and appends to a `large_table`
- Serves REST and GraphQL endpoints
- Includes endpoints:
  - `/upload`, `/download/<source>`, `/sources`, `/delete/<source>`
- Modular GraphQL API for advanced queries
- Supports ELT model (extract + load, then transform in-database)

### 🔹 [TAFLAB_frontend](https://github.com/dustinteng/TAFLAB_frontend)

> React.js frontend for live control, visual feedback, and data analysis

- Live boat map with route setting and telemetry overlays
- Manual control with joystick and slider
- Heatmap visualization of environmental data (temperature/wind)
- CSV file management, data previews, and time-slider control
- Responsive UI with drag-and-drop legends and dropdowns

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Boat (Raspberry Pi) Setup

```bash
# On each Raspberry Pi
cd TAFLAB_boatpi_roshumble
# Setup ROS2 workspace and dependencies
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
# Launch boat control stack
ros2 launch captain captain.launch.py
```

### 2. Backend (Shore Station)

```bash
cd TAFLAB_backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

### 3. Frontend (Dashboard)

```bash
cd TAFLAB_frontend
npm install
npm start
```
